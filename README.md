# PSR-4 Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate
A very barebones boilerplate for creating WP plugins, the purpose of this project is to suit as many purposes as possible whilst having the lowest possible dependencies.

## Features
* [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) support
* Utilises [PHPDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc)
* No extra dependencies
* Strict types

## Requirements
The slogan for this project is "if it can run WordPress it can run this plugin" - however, because of all the PHP 7 benefits I've decided to not go with a backwards-compatible approach here, if your server runs PHP 5.x do yourself as well as your community a favour and [upgrade now](https://wpengine.com/resources/upgrading-to-php-7/).

## More info will be added soonâ„¢
The project is still very WIP, I will polish this README whilst adding features.
